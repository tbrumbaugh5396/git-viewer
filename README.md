### Install Python Dependencies

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Meta CLI (Optional)

For meta repository support, install the meta package globally:

```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the application using one of these methods:

**Method 1 (Main launcher):**
```bash
python3 git_viewer.py
```

**Method 2 (Package module):**
```bash
python3 -m src.git_viewer
```

**Method 3 (From package directory):**
```bash
cd src/git_viewer && python3 run.py
```

**Method 4 (After installation):**

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+O` | Open Repository |
| `Ctrl+N` | Clone Repository |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Exit Application |
| `Ctrl+P` | Git Pull |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Git Push |
| `Ctrl+F` | Git Fetch |
| `Ctrl+M` | Commit Changes |
| `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Merge Branch |
| `Ctrl+,` | Configuration |
| `Ctrl+T` | Open Terminal |

## Tips and Best Practices

### Git Workflow
1. **Always fetch before starting work**: Use `Ctrl+F` to fetch latest changes
2. **Create feature branches**: Use "New Branch" for new features
3. **Review changes before committing**: Use the Diff panel to review changes
4. **Write meaningful commit messages**: Include context and reasoning

### Meta Repository Workflow
1. **Initialize carefully**: Make sure your directory structure is ready before running `meta init`
2. **Keep projects updated**: Regularly run "Git Update" to sync all projects
3. **Use consistent naming**: Use clear, consistent names for projects
4. **Leverage meta commands**: Use meta commands to perform operations across all projects

### Performance Tips
1. **Large repositories**: For very large repositories, some operations may take time
2. **File viewing**: Large files are truncated for performance
3. **Background operations**: Long-running commands execute in background threads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Git not found" Error
- Ensure Git is installed and in your system PATH
- Restart the application after installing Git

#### "Meta CLI not available"
- Install the meta package: `npm install -g meta`
- Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed

#### Repository Loading Issues
- Verify the directory is a valid Git repository
- Check file permissions
- Ensure you're not in a subdirectory of the repository

#### Performance Issues
- Close unnecessary applications
- Limit the number of commits displayed in large repositories
- Use the refresh button if data seems stale

### Getting Help

1. **Check Git Status**: Use Git status to understand repository state
2. **View Output**: Check the Output tab for detailed error messages
3. **Terminal Access**: Use "Open Terminal" to run commands manually
4. **Git Documentation**: Refer to official Git documentation for Git-specific issues
